## Important takeways

1. Understanding the behaviours between primitive and objects.
2. How do they behave when passed as an argument?
3. Immutable !== it cannot be re-assigned.
4. Primitives are always pass by value
5. Objects are always pass by reference
6. Be wary of destructive methods and non-destructive methods.
7. It's important to draw a distinction between the process of assignment and reassignment of variables and the concept of mutability.
8. Creating a global variable within a function with the same name as its arguments would re-assign that name to that global variable deeming your argument obsolete.$$
